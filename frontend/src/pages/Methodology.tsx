For a campus-year taken from an older release, a match with another campus in that same release counts too, even if that campus has since corrected its figures. School pages show the figures as DOE publishes them; state and national totals and rankings count them once, under one host campus, which the school page names. The host is the campus whose figures come from the newest release for that year, then the main campus, then the one with more students (FTE), then the larger total, then the lower IPEDS ID.

                  rate divides the incidents of all the institution's campuses that year by the institution's FTE.
                  Rate rankings list institutions, one row each, under the institution's name and linked to its main
                  campus (or, when the main campus did not report, its campus with the most incidents that year);
                  school pages and Compare label such a rate "all N campuses combined". Rankings by count still list
                  each campus. The incidents are counted as in rankings: residence halls are not added (they are part
                  of on-campus), and figures also reported by another campus count once.

                  enrolled exclusively in distance education): Clery figures cover the campus, which most of their
                  students never attend, so their rate is not comparable. School pages still show these rates, with a
                  note. An institution without NCES's online figure is not left out. In fall 2020 and 2021, when many
                  institutions taught mostly online, many more are left out: about 680 of the 2,260 institutions with
